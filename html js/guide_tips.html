    <h2>Pharming Basics</h2>
    <p>Farming is one of the most important parts of the game, especially for carries. It is about effectively killing creeps (units) to earn gold and experience. Here are some tips:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Last hit of creeps**: Try to land the last hit on the creep to get gold.</li>
      <li>**Denai**: Take experience from your enemies by killing your creeps (deniy).</li>
      <li>**Lane Control**: Keep the lane close to your tower to reduce the risk of being ganked (attacked) by enemies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to choose a hero depending on the enemy team</h2>
    <p>Hero selection is a critical moment in every Dota 2 game. Here are a few factors to consider when choosing a hero:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Strengths and Weaknesses**: Learn which heroes can counter the characters chosen by your enemies.</li>
      <li>**Team Synergy**: Your hero should fit well into the team's overall strategy. If your team relies on magic damage, choose a hero with magic abilities.</li>
      <li>**Role Balance**: Make sure your team has all the right roles: tank, support, carry, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important tactical tips</h2>
    <h3>Map control</h3>
    <p>Vision of the map gives your team a huge advantage. Place wards at key points on the map (for example, on runes or near Roshan) to track enemy movements and avoid surprise attacks.</p>

    <h3>Roshan timing</h3>
    <p>Roshan is a powerful neutral unit that can be killed to gain Aegis of the Immortal, giving one player the ability to revive after death. It is important to keep in mind its respawn time (usually 8-11 minutes after killing it) and prepare to fight for this unit.</p>

    <h3>Teamwork</h3>
    <p>Even if you are strong as an individual player, success depends on teamwork. Coordinate with your team, plan attacks and protect each other. It's important to listen and suggest strategies based on how the game is going.</p>
